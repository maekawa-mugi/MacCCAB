# MacCCAB
Reverse engineering attempt of the Macintosh Color Classic Analog Board (AB) model 820-0360-B


The project has stalled, it's a long process, contributions or branched are welcome.

Tasks:
- to do a thorough check;
- donate a non working Analogue BoardB, so that I can remove the components to measure the values (uF, Ohm);
- help me with kiCad, I'm clumsly with it

Thanks to:
- https://powercc.org for pins and some capacitors readings
- techniktobi for fixing some caps values
