# MacCCAB
Reverse engineering attempt of the Macintosh Color Classic Analog Board (AB)

The project is on-going, it's a long process, I dunno yet if I'll finish it.

Contributors are welcome:
- to do a thorough check;
- donate a non working Analogue BoardB, so that I can remove the components to measure the values (uF, Ohm);
- help me with kiCad

Thanks to https://powercc.org for pins and some capacitors readings
