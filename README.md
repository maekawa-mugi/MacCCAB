# MacCCAB
Reverse engineering of the Macintosh Color Classic Analog Board

The project is on-going, it's a long process, I dunno yet if I'll finish it.

Contributors are welcome:
- to a thorough check;
- donate a AB, not working is fine, so that I can remove the components to measure the values (uF, Ohm);
- shortly help me with kiCad
